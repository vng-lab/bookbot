# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This bot looks at the text of a file located in the "bookbot/books/" folder and prints an output that lists the word count followed by a count of each alphabetical character from greatest to least.

NOTE: The CLI call should be in the bookbot folder using this syntax: "python3 main.py <path to book>"
Example: "python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt"
